☐ Build a formula-tree generation system
    ☐ Random, but still correct, formulas given a chosen length
    ☐ Modal depth regulation
    ☐ Memoization regulation
    ☐ Test and think about other parameters to tweak

☐ Build an appropriate model generation system

☐ Write a Relations hierarchy (in SoleLogics!) thus extending KripkeModel's `Adjacents`

☐ Find a way to memoize "a DISJUNCTION b" with the same hash as "b  DISJUNCTION a"; 
☐ Hashing could be removed (just do hash(token(node)) )

☐ maybe L could operate through intersection between sets

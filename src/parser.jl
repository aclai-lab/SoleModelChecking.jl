Shunting yard algorithm explanation.

Goal:
translate an infix expression to postfix notation. (also called Reverse Polish Notation)
e.g. "□c∧◊d" becomes "c□d◊∧"
This preprocessing is useful to simplify formula (syntax) trees generations.

Data structures involved:
* `postfix`: vector of tokens (String or AbstractOperator) in RPN; this is returned
* `opstack`: stack of tokens (AbstractOperators except for the "(" string)

Algorithm:
given a certain token `tok`, 1 of 4 possible scenarios may occur:
(regrouped in _shunting_yard function to keep code clean)

1. `tok` is a valid propositional letter
    -> push "p" in `postfix`

2. `tok` is an opening bracket
    -> push "(" in `operators`

3. `tok` is a closing bracket
    -> pop from `opstack`.
    If an operator is popped, then push it into `postfix` and repeat.
    Else, if an opening bracket it's found then process the next token.
    This algorithm step it's the reason why "(" are placed in `opstack`
    and `opstack` content type is Union{AbstractOperator, String}.

4. `tok` has to be an operator
    -> pop `op` from `opstack` and push it into `postfix` if it has an higher precedence
    than `tok` and repeat.
    When the condition is no more satisfied, then it means we have found the correct
    spot where to place `tok` in `opstack`.
